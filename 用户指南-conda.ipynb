    "### What is a conda package?\n",
    "A conda package is a compressed tarball file (.tar.bz2) or .conda file that contains:\n",
    "+ system-level libraries  \n",
    "+ Python or other modules  \n",
    "+ executable programs and other components  \n",
    "+ metadata under the info/ directory  \n",
    "+ a collection of files that are installed directly into an install prefix\n",
    "\n",
    "### .conda file format\n",
    "These compressed files can be significantly smaller than their bzip2 equivalents. In addition, they decompress much more quickly. .conda is the preferred file format to use where available, although we continue to provide .tar.bz2 files in tandem.\n",
    "> Note  \n",
    "> In conda 4.7 and later, you cannot use package names that end in “.conda” as they conflict with the .conda file format for packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using packages\n",
    "+ You may search for packages\n",
    "      conda search scipy\n",
    "+ You may install a packages\n",
    "      conda install scipy\n",

    "### Metapackages\n",
    "当conda包仅用于元数据不含任何文件时，它被称为元包  \n",
    "An example of a metapackage is \"anaconda,\" which collects together all the packages in the Anaconda installer. The command conda create -n envname anaconda creates an environment that exactly matches what would be created from the Anaconda installer. You can create metapackages with the conda metapackage command. Include the name and version in the command.  \n",
    "+ Anaconda metapackage  \n",
    "The Anaconda metapackage is used in the creation of the Anaconda Distribution installers so that they have a set of packages associated with them.  \n",
    "read more https://www.anaconda.com/whats-in-a-name-clarifying-the-anaconda-metapackage/\n",
    "+ Mutex metapackage  \n",
    "    A mutex metapackage is a very simple package that has a name.  \n",
    "    Let's look at some examples for how to use mutex metapackages to build NumPy against different BLAS implementations.\n",
    "    + Building NumPy with BLAS variants  \n",
    "        If you build NumPy with MKL, you also need to build SciPy, scikit-learn, and anything else using BLAS also with MKL. It is important to ensure that these “variants” (packages built with a particular set of options) are installed together and never with an alternate BLAS implementation.\n",
    "    + Installing NumPy with BLAS variants\n",
    "        To specify which variant of NumPy that you want, you could potentially specify the BLAS library you want:\n",
    "          conda install numpy mkl\n",
    "        This pathway may lead to some ambiguity and solutions with mixed BLAS, so using the metapackage is recommended. To specify MKL-powered NumPy in a non-ambiguous way, you can specify the mutex package (either directly or indirectly):\n",
    "          conda install numpy “blas=*=mkl”\n",
    "    + Track_features  \n",
    "        One of conda’s optimization goals is to minimize the number of track_features needed to specify the desired specs. By adding track_features to one or more of the options, conda will de-prioritize it or “weigh it down.” The lowest priority package is the one that would cause the most track_features to be activated in the environment. The default package among many variants is the one that would cause the least track_features to be activated.\n",

    "### Noarch packages\n",
    "Noarch packages are packages that are not architecture specific and therefore only have to be built once. Noarch packages are either generic or Python. Noarch generic packages allow users to distribute docs, datasets, and source code in conda packages  \n",
    "#### Noarch Python\n",
    "Noarch Python packages cut down on the overhead of building multiple different pure Python packages on different architectures and Python versions by sorting out platform and Python version-specific differences at install time.  \n",
    "In order to qualify as a noarch Python package, all of the following criteria must be fulfilled:\n",
    "+ No compiled extensions\n",
    "+ No post-link or pre-link or pre-unlink scripts\n",
    "+ No OS-specific build scripts\n",
    "+ No python version specific requirements\n",
    "+ No skips except for Python version. If the recipe is py3 only, remove skip statement and add version constraint on Python in host and run section.\n",
    "+ 2to3 is not used\n",
    "+ Scripts argument in setup.py is not used\n",
    "+ If console_script entrypoints are in setup.py, they are listed in meta.yaml\n",

    "+ Tagged versions have a suffix that specifies a particular property of interest, e.g. 1.1.parallel. Tags can be added to any of the preceding 4 types. As far as sorting is concerned, tags are treated like strings in pre-release versions.\n",
    "+ An optional local version string separated by + can be appended to the main (upstream) version string. It is only considered in comparisons when the main versions are equal, but otherwise handled in exactly the same manner.\n",
